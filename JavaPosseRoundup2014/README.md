## Lightning talk from the Java Posse Roundup 2014

The material discusses two topics:

* A string formatting system I built that avoids allocation and performs better than built in formatting.
* How atomic operations on volatile fields could be safely implemented (the `.volatile` proposal for Java 8).

The latter of these is what was actually presented at the Roudup.
